# Predicting-digits-and-intonations-from-audio-files
In this project we use the Mile End Spoken Numerals dataset comprised of 20 thousand audio files from multiple participants. Each audio file corresponds to a given digit and intonation. With this dataset we attempt to extract signifficantly important features and build a plethora of machine learning models in order to predict both the digit and intonation of a given audio file. We then use both these models to create a password identifier where a gicen password will be accepted if and only if a sequence of digits and their corresponding intonations is corect.
NOTE: This dataset is not publicly available yet!
